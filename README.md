# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hi, I'm Sergi!

I recently completed my studies in Web Development after finishing a vocational degree in IT. From a young age, I've been passionate about video games, which sparked my interest in computers and, eventually, programming.

What I enjoy most about development is the ability to bring ideas to life through code—merging logic and creativity to build useful and visually appealing web experiences.

I'm constantly looking to grow as a developer and expand my skillset. I'm particularly interested in frontend technologies and creative coding projects, but I'm also comfortable working across the full stack.

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect, collaborate, or have an interesting opportunity to share!
